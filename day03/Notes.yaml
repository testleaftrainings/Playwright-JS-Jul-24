Key core components
1. Browser instance - copy of the browser (browser)
2. Browser Context - an isolated environment within the browser instance
                   - akin to incognito session
                   - operates independently with its own cookies, local storage, and cache
                   - making it possible to run tests in parallel without any shared state
3. Page - an individual tab or a window within the browser context
        - helps to interact with the web elements
