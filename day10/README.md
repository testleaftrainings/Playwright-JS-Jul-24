### Agenda for Day 10: Window, File upload & download

ðŸ“Œ Multiple Windows/Tabs
ðŸ“Œ File Upload 
ðŸ“Œ File Download

## Handling Multiple Windows (Pop-ups)

Managing multiple windows is vital for comprehensive testing, particularly for applications that open new tabs or windows.

### Sequential Approach

```javascript
// Sequentially handling new windows
    const windowPromise = context.waitForEvent('page');
    await page.getByText("Open",{exact:true}).click();
    const window = await windowPromise;
```

### Promise.all for Multiple Windows

```javascript
// Coordinating the opening of several windows simultaneously
const [window1, window2] = await Promise.all([
    context.waitForEvent('page'),
    context.waitForEvent('page'),
    page.click('#open-first-window'),
    page.click('#open-second-window')
]);
```

### waitForEvent('page')

```javascript
// Detecting a new page following an action
const newPage = await context.waitForEvent('page');
page.click('#open-new-window');
```

## File Upload

Automating file uploads through web forms is crucial for testing upload functionalities.

### setInputFiles

```javascript
// Setting files on input elements to simulate file selection
await page.setInputFiles('#upload-selector', 'path/to/file.txt');
```

### setFiles

```javascript
// Interacting with file chooser dialogs
const [fileChooser] = await Promise.all([
    page.waitForEvent('filechooser'),
    page.click('#upload-btn')
]);
await fileChooser.setFiles('path/to/file.txt');
```
## File Downloads with Playwright

Automating file downloads ensures the correct handling of files from web applications. This guide covers managing the download process and saving the downloaded files to a specific location using Playwright.

### Download Event and suggestedFilename

To manage the download process and retrieve the suggested filename, use the `download` event in combination with the `suggestedFilename()` method.

### Example

```javascript
const fileDownloadPromise = page.waitForEvent('download');
await page.getByRole('button', {name:'Download'}).click();
const fileDownloader = await fileDownloadPromise;
console.log('Suggested Filename:', download.suggestedFilename());
```

In this example, Playwright waits for the download event to be triggered by clicking on the download link. Once the download starts, it logs the suggested filename.

### Saving the Downloaded File

To save the downloaded file to a specific location, use the `download.path()` method along with the `saveAs()` method.

### Example

```javascript
const path = await download.path();
await download.saveAs('/path/to/save/file');
```

This example demonstrates how to retrieve the path of the downloaded file and save it to a specified location on your filesystem.

### Final Notes

- **Ensure Correct Paths**: Make sure the paths to save the files are correctly specified and that the application has the necessary permissions to write to those paths.
- **Handling Multiple Downloads**: For handling multiple downloads, ensure each download event and file save operation is correctly awaited to avoid conflicts.
