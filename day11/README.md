## 1. What is API and API Testing?
### What is an API?
An **Application Programming Interface (API)** is a set of rules and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate with each other. It serves as an interface between different software applications or components.

### What is API Testing?
**API testing** is a type of software testing that verifies that APIs function correctly, both in isolation and as part of a system. It focuses on areas such as functionality, reliability, performance, and security.

## 2. Tools for API Testing
Popular tools for API testing include:
- **Postman**: User-friendly for both manual and automated testing.
- **SoapUI**: Suitable for SOAP and REST APIs, supporting functional and load testing.
- **Curl**: Command-line tool for transferring data with URLs.
- **JMeter**: Used for load testing and also supports functional testing.

## 3. Postman Basics
**Postman** simplifies the creation, management, and execution of API tests with features for:
- **Creating requests**: Configuring API requests including URL, method, headers, and body.
- **Automated testing**: Scripting tests in JavaScript.
- **Collections and environments**: Organizing requests and managing variables.

## 4. Different Types of API
APIs are categorized as:
- **REST**: Utilizes HTTP methods and is widely used in web services.
- **SOAP**: Uses XML for messaging and is protocol-specific.
- **GraphQL**: Efficient in complex systems by allowing requests for specific data.
- **gRPC**: A high-performance RPC framework that uses Protocol Buffers and HTTP/2.

## 5. What is REST API?
A **REST API** operates using HTTP requests to perform CRUD operations on web resources. It is stateless, requiring each client request to be complete and self-contained.

## 6. Request and Response
- **Request**: Includes HTTP method, URL, headers, and body.
- **Response**: Contains a status code, headers, and data.

## 7. Verbs
HTTP verbs include:
- **GET**: Retrieve resources.
- **POST**: Create resources.
- **PUT**: Update resources.
- **PATCH**: Partially update resources, modifying specific elements without affecting the whole.
- **DELETE**: Remove resources.

## 8. Headers
HTTP headers are key-value pairs in requests and responses that define parameters, authentication, and more.

Common types of HTTP headers include:
- **Content-Type**: Specifies the media type of the resource.
- **Authorization**: Credentials for authenticating a user to access resources.
- **Accept**: Media type that the client is willing to receive.
- **Cache-Control**: Directives for caching mechanisms in both requests and responses.

## 9. Body
The body of requests and responses carries data relevant to the API transaction.

Common body content types include:
- **application/json**: Data is structured in JSON format.
- **application/xml**: Data is structured in XML format.
- **application/x-www-form-urlencoded**: Data is encoded as key-value pairs, similar to query parameters in the URL.
- **multipart/form-data**: Used for uploading files, allowing you to send files as data.

## 10. Status Codes from 2xx to 5xx
Status codes indicate the outcome of API requests:
- **2xx**: Indicate successful operations.
- **3xx**: Indicate redirections.
- **4xx**: Indicate client errors.
- **5xx**: Indicate server errors.
